   <h3><b>Nyarch Linux</b> is a Linux distribution <b>made for weebs</b>, based on ArchLinux and EzArcher.</h3><br />

</div>

## Is it safe to use?
It is strongly suggested to <b>do not use this Linux distribution as daily drive</b>, since it is not made by a team of experts and there are way better distros out there. <br />

### Will there be other DEs spins?
- KDE Plasma

However in order to make them good, **we need contributions**. If you are interested in helping us, please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchLinux/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
<br />
Please note that we want to make the different spins as coherent as possible, so applications have to follow their desktop philosophy if possible. <br />
For example, in the Gnome spin Komikku, a GTK application to read mangas, is preinstalled. In a KDE Plasma spin, if there is a similar application written using QT, it should be included.
